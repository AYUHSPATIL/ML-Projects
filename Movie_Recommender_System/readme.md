# 🎬 Movie Recommender System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **content-based movie recommendation system** built using **Streamlit** for deployment. It suggests movies based on similarity with the selected movie using **cosine similarity** on movie features.  

---

## 💡 Project Idea  
The goal of this project is to recommend **5 similar movies** based on a selected movie.  
- We use **content-based filtering** to find similarities between movies.  
- The **cosine similarity** metric helps determine movie closeness based on feature vectors.  
- A **precomputed similarity matrix** makes recommendations efficient.

## ⚙ Technologies Used  
- 🐍 **Python**  
- 📦 **Pandas**  
- 🔢 **NumPy**  
- 🖥 **Streamlit** (for web app deployment)  
- 🎭 **Pickle** (for model persistence)

## 🗂 Data Description  
The dataset contains information about movies such as:  
- 🎬 **Title**  
- 🏷 **Genres**  
- 📅 **Release Date**  
- 📝 **Overview (Description)**  
- 🎭 **Cast & Crew**  

--- 

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
We analyze the movie dataset to understand:  
- 📌 **Distribution of movies** by genre, language, etc.  
- 🔍 **Most common genres** in the dataset.  
- 🎭 **Popular movies** based on metadata.  
- 📈 **Feature engineering** to improve recommendations.

## 📊 Model & Algorithm  

🔹 **Content-Based Filtering** is used to recommend similar movies.  
🔹 **TF-IDF Vectorization** converts movie descriptions into numerical format.  
🔹 **Cosine Similarity** computes the closeness between movies based on their feature vectors.  
🔹 **Pickle Serialization** ensures fast loading of the dataset for real-time recommendations.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Recommends 5 similar movies** based on user selection  
✔ **Interactive UI** with **Streamlit**  
✔ **Precomputed similarity matrix** for fast recommendations  
✔ **Easy deployment**

## 🔮 Future Improvements  

🔹 **Enhance recommendations** by integrating **collaborative filtering** for better accuracy.  
🔹 **Integrate TMDb API** to fetch **movie posters, ratings, and descriptions** dynamically.  
🔹 **Improve UI/UX** with better visuals and user interaction using Streamlit.  
🔹 **Deploy on cloud platforms** like **Streamlit Cloud, Render, or Heroku** for easy accessibility.
