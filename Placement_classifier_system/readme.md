## Project Overview 🚀

This project aims to predict the placement status of a student based on their CGPA and IQ. The model is trained on a dataset containing CGPA, IQ, and placement status (0 or 1). It leverages Logistic Regression to classify students as either placed or not placed. This model can assist educational institutions in identifying students who may need additional support to improve their placement chances.

The value proposition is to provide a simple, yet effective, tool for predicting placement outcomes, enabling proactive interventions and resource allocation. The problem being solved is the uncertainty and lack of data-driven insights in student placement predictions.

## Key Features ✨

*   **CGPA-based Prediction:** Uses Cumulative Grade Point Average as a key predictor.
*   **IQ-based Prediction:** Integrates Intelligence Quotient as another important factor.
*   **Logistic Regression Model:** Employs a widely-used classification algorithm for accurate predictions.
*   **Scalable:** Can be trained on larger datasets with more features for enhanced accuracy.
*   **Easy to Use:** Simple installation and usage with clear instructions.

## Visual Demo 📊

> *Replace this section with screenshots or GIFs demonstrating the project's functionality. For example, show the model's prediction output for a sample student.*

## Prerequisites ⚙️

Before running this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

*   Python (>=3.7)
*   pandas (version >= 1.1.0)
*   numpy (version >= 1.19.0)
*   scikit-learn (version >= 0.24.0)
*   matplotlib (version >= 3.0.0)
*   mlxtend (version >= 0.18.0)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd ML-Projects
        This script performs the following actions:
    *   Loads the data from `placement.csv`.
    *   Preprocesses the data (feature scaling).
    *   Trains a Logistic Regression model.
    *   Evaluates the model's accuracy.
    *   Visualizes the decision boundary.

###  Code Configuration ⚙️

> *Detail any configurable options with examples.*
>
> For example:
>
> *   You can configure the test size in the `train_test_split` function:
>
> # Load the model
model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))

# Load the scaler used during training
sc = StandardScaler()
# Dummy data to fit the scaler (replace with your actual training data)
X_train_dummy = np.array([[6.0, 120.0], [5.0, 100.0]])
sc.fit(X_train_dummy)  # Fit the scaler

# Prepare the new data (CGPA and IQ)
new_data = np.array([[7.0, 130.0]])

> *Provide detailed information about the key functions and methods in your project. This is especially useful if the project includes a library or API.*
>
> For example:
>
> ### `predict(cgpa, iq)`
>
> Predicts the placement status based on CGPA and IQ.
>
> **Parameters:**
>
> *   `cgpa` (float): Cumulative Grade Point Average.
> *   `iq` (float): Intelligence Quotient.
>
> **Returns:**
>
> *   `int`: 1 if the student is predicted to be placed, 0 otherwise.
>
> **Example:**

## Troubleshooting 🐛

> *Document common issues and their solutions.*
>
> For example:
>
> *   **Issue:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn'`
>
>     **Solution:** Ensure that scikit-learn is installed. Run `pip install scikit-learn`.
>
>     > *Discuss any performance bottlenecks and potential optimizations.*
>
> For example:
>
> *   The Logistic Regression model is relatively fast for prediction.
> *   For larger datasets, consider using more advanced algorithms or optimizing the feature scaling process.

## Security Notes 🔒

> *Address any security concerns related to the project.*
>
> For example:
>
> *   Ensure that the input data is validated to prevent malicious inputs.
> *   The model file (`model.pkl`) should be protected from unauthorized access.

## Roadmap 🗺️

*   Implement a user-friendly web interface.
*   Add more features (e.g., extracurricular activities, skills) to improve prediction accuracy.
*   Implement other classification models for comparison.
*   Create API endpoints for easy integration with other systems.
